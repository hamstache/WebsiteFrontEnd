	<h1> About </h1>
    <p class="about-text">Select different ingredients you would like in your recipe and we will match you with delicious recipes using those foods.
The internet is a seemingly infinite information space. This wealth of information has a downside. Locating what you need. Search engines are useful tools for directing you to an ordered list of sites that may have references to the information desired. Depending on what you are seeking, you may need to either refine your search criteria multiple times, or spend time investigating individual sites within your search results.</p><br>
 
<p class="about-text">The term 'whittle' may not be commonly known these days, but whittling remains a pastime for those who enjoy shaping or crafting an object from a piece of wood using a pocket knife. Whittlerz.com was developed to help you 'shape' your search results by applying selectors as search criteria. Whittlerz.com is not a generalized search engine. It is intended for specialized searches of specific topic areas. Whittlerz for Recipes helps you find recipes quickly.</p><br>
<p class="about-text">There are plenty of sites and blogs hosting recipes. Specific recipes may be found using general search engines to return results across sites. Many recipe sites offer methods to find recipes within their sites, such as searching for recipes by keyword, or filtering recipe lists by type (e.g. breakfast, side dish, vegetarian).</p><br>
 
<p class="about-text">Whittlerz for Recipes allows you to search for recipes by ingredients. These may be ingredients already available in your pantry or refrigerator. Many other sites allow you to do this, but we don't believe this is enough. For example, what if the recipes returned contain ingredients your diet does not allow, such as dairy products. Whittlerz for Recipes also allows you to specify ingredients you do not want in order to shape your results faster.</p><br>
 
<p class="about-text">Whittlerz for Recipes also classifies ingredients into a food hierarchy.</p><br>
 
<p class="about-text">This lets you select general ingredient categories such as meats, pasta, or vegetables. You can navigate through the food hierarchy to select ingredient categories, or ultimately, individual ingredients. For example, the 'meat' category breaks down into beef, pork, poultry, and sausage. The next level of sausage in the hierarchy includes air dried, cured, fresh, or smoked sausage. Finally, smoked sausage includes, andouille, chorizo, kielbasa, and mortadella. This may not be an exhaustive list of smoked sausages, but what appears in the hierarchy are actually found as ingredients in cataloged recipes. This helps to avoid empty search results.</p><br>
<p class="about-text">You can also enter ingredients directly if desired. The food hierarchy items are included in this mode so you can enter them as well.</p><br>
 
<p class="about-text">To better understand how Whittlerz for Recipes works, you can watch an instructional video.
We are always attempting to make Whittlerz for Recipes a better user experience. Please feel free to send us any comments or suggestions on how to improve the product.</p><br>
 
<p class="about-text">Happy Whittling!</p>
